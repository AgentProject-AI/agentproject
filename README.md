# Welcome to the Agent Project

A practical guide written by practitioners to help get your Agents running, scaling, and operating in production.

Given the many confusing options, [<mark style="background-color:yellow;">https://www.AgentProject.ai</mark>](https://www.agentproject.ai) aims to guide you through the choices, tools, and best practices to ensure your Agent project starts and runs in production.

The github repo is here : [https://github.com/AgentProject-AI/agentproject](https://github.com/AgentProject-AI/agentproject)
