###

### Score Interpretation

* 4.5 - 5.0: Industry Leading
* 4.0 - 4.4: Production Ready
* 3.5 - 3.9: Mature
* 3.0 - 3.4: Developing
* 2.0 - 2.9: Basic
* Below 2.0: Early Stage



### Different Dimensions of the Scorecard

#### 1. Learning Experience&#x20;

* **Documentation Quality** (1-5)
  * Comprehensiveness
  * Up-to-date content
  * Code examples and tutorials
* **Learning Curve** (1-5)
  * Time to basic proficiency - How easy is it to get started with the framework and understand the core concepts?
  * Complexity of concepts
  * Available learning resources
*   **Developer Tools** (1-5)

    * IDE support
    * Debugging capabilities
    * Testing frameworks



#### 2. Architecture & Design&#x20;



* **Deployability** (1-5)

How easy is it to deploy the framework in a distributed environment, different cloud providers (Azure, GCP, and AWS) and scale its performance?

* **Scalability** (1-5)
  * Handling of concurrent agents
  * Resource management
  * Performance under load
  * Consider the support for asynchronous messaging.
* **Flexibility** (1-5)
  * Ability to handle different types of tasks
  * Customization options
  * Integration capabilities

#### 3. Capabilities & Features&#x20;

* **Core Agent Features** (1-5)
  * Planning and reasoning
  * Memory management
    * Look at the ability to monitor trends in the number of calls and latency, and the ability to view traces from the application.
    * Consider if it is easy to avoid memory overflow.
    * Look at options for memory, such as short-term and RAG on memory.
  * Decision-making capabilities
* **Tool Integration** (1-5)
  * Built-in tools
  * Ease of adding new tools
  * Consider the ease of using both closed-source and open-source models.
  * Consider the level of support for different tools, or whether a 'proxy' server is needed to integrate.
  * See whether the framework supports remote tool execution.
  * API integrations
* **Important Features** (1-5)
  * **Streaming**: Does the framework support streaming of tokens or messages?
  * **Human-in-the-Loop**: How well does it support human intervention?
  * **Languages**: What programming languages does it support?
  * **Low-Code Tools**: Does it offer a low-code interface for creating agents?
* **Language Model Support** (1-5)
  * Number of supported LLMs
  * Ease of switching between models
  * Implementation quality

#### 4. Production Readiness&#x20;

* **Stability** (1-5)
  * Production track record
  * Bug frequency
  * Update reliability
* **Security** (1-5)
  * Authentication & authorization
  * Data protection
  * Security best practices
*   **Monitoring & Observability** (1-5)

    * Logging capabilities
    * Performance metrics
      * Look at the ability to monitor trends in the number of calls and latency, and the ability to view traces from the application.
    * Debugging tools
    * **Time Travel**: Can you go back in time after a task is completed to see how the agent behaved?
    * Look for the ability to monitor tokens used, latency, and error rates.



#### 5. Community & Support&#x20;

* **Community Size** (1-5)
  * GitHub stars/forks
  * Active contributors
  * Community engagement
  * Market place for Agents
* **Support Quality** (1-5)
